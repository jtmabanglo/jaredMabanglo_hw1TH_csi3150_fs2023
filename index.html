      <p>Welcome to my Portfolio Website! My name is Jared Mabanglo. I am a senior majoring in Computer Science at
        Oakland University. Through my school coursework, I have gained experience in Java, C, and am currently learning HTML and CSS.
        I have gained some experience in my current position in a Home Health Care Agency, helping the agency navigate a transition from paper medical records to
        an Electronic Medical Records platform and navigaing a change to a new HIPAA-Compliant Communications platform, which afforded me opportunities to gain 
        experience working with clients on finding the best solution possible to meet their needs, and training the staff to be adequately
        equipped to utilize this new software.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, I am looking for internship opportunities to gain more experience in the field. I am interested in Software Engineering
        and would like to gain experience in both Front and Back End Development. From my background I do have experience in working in the Health
        Care sector, but am open to exploring job opportunities in other sectors as well!
      </p>
